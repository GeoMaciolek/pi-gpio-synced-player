# pi-gpio-synced-player

## Overview

A quick script to facilitate syncronized playback of video across multiple
Raspberry Pi units

### Why

This is a modification of a script written for a specific art installation. It
likely won't be broadly useful!

## Details

This script uses the `omxplayer` (deprecated as of 2023) and the `keyboard`
Python module ("pressing keys" in the player) in tandem with simple GPIO
communications to ensure players start in sync.

## Wiring
